-- UnitedHealth has a program called Advocate4Me, 
-- which allows members to call an advocate and 
-- receive support for their health care needs 
-- â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, 
-- health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.
-- Write a query to find how many UHG members made 3 or more calls. 
-- case_id column uniquely identifies each call made.

-- Solution --

SELECT COUNT(policy_holder_id) AS member_count
FROM (SELECT 
  policy_holder_id, 
  COUNT(case_id) AS call_count 
FROM  callers
GROUP BY policy_holder_id	
HAVING COUNT(case_id) >= 3
) AS call_records
;
